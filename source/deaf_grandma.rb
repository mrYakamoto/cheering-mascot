# Run this file via the command line (Terminal) like so:
#   $ ruby deaf_grandma.rb
#
# Your program should get user input which corresponds
# to you saying something to Grandma. Grandma should respond
# differently depending on the input you provide, or the
# program should exit.  See the README file for detailed rules.




# Get input from the user--what is said to grandma
def say_something
end

# Determine Grandma's response based on the argument
# passed to the method
def grandmas_response(input)
end

# Print the argument passed to the method
def display(response)
end

# This method will control the flow of the application,
# making use of the other three methods.
def deaf_grandma

deaf_grandma     # This line calls the method you're writing
